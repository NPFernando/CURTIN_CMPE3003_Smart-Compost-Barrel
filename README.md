# Smart-Compost-Barrel

Sri Lanka generates 7000 tons of solid waste per day and disposes of it in landfill, contributing 
to greenhouse gas emissions. Out of 65-66, present consists of degradable organic materials. 
Accordingly, 3963 tonnes of food waste are generated per day. Many farmed fields ceased 
producing or saw a halving of their output when the government forbade the purchase of 
artificial fertilisers. Since many farmers are not accustomed to utilising carbonic fertilisers, 
the government encourages their usage. Due to this predicament, people start growing in 
their gardens and utilise composted fertiliser for their landscaping. Many individuals still 
utilise outdated compost processing methods and compost bins to generate manure. It does 
need supervision and moister for better results, but most people neglect these procedures 
because they have other things to do. The resources of the existing system are also expensive, 
ineffective, and fraught with problems. To solve this problem, the research aims to provide 
quality manure created from household organic waste using the smart composting barrel. 
The composite barrel will need 14 days for composting process. During this process, the smart 
compost barrel collects the moisture content and barrel emptiness by scanning barrel depth. 
With Arduino UNO microcontroller for automated water motor and Norde MCU collect depth 
data and inform user next step need to proceed by collecting data via WIFI. After the process 
is complete, the user can collect manure. With this prototype we will improve quality and 
improve user manageability and automation to the higher level.
